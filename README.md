<h1> Watch Out </h1>
<p>
 This project is divided into two parts, and the main motivation behind its development is to address the increasing issues related to women's rape, violence, and other similar concerns. It also aims to tackle situations similar to the one depicted in the movie "URI," where Vicky Kaushal's mother faced a problem causing her to forget everything and run away. To provide a solution to these challenges, we have developed an app that allows users to track their family members using Google Maps. Additionally, users can seek help from the police by simply clicking a button, which will provide the police with real-time and accurate coordinates.
